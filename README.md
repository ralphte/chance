# Chance Web App


Basic Go Web App

This project is a VERY simple web app to demonstrate SOME web application security in GO. The app uses MySQL for a database and has a simple profile update page. All user accounts are pre seeded in the database.

I would not use this project to start a real web app as there are a few projects that are much better starting points.

To download, run the following command:

~~~
go get github.com/ralphte/chance
~~~

Use sql_input for pre populated MySQL input
